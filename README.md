## Using with Claude for Desktop

1. Edit your Claude for Desktop configuration file:

- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

2. Add the following to your configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "total-pc-control": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": [
        "/ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/total-pc-control/build/index.js"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Replace `/ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/` with the actual path to where you cloned the repository.

3. Restart Claude for Desktop
